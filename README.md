Description
---------------

Desktop Dungeon __(name pending)__ is an *HTML5* Web Application that gives access to users a set of tools that would allow them to continue a live game of Dungeons and Dragons when unable to meet. These tools include a *chat window*, a *dice roller*, a *map editor* and a *unit system* __(More features to come)__

The use is not limited to D&D, but it is being developped with that in mind.

Also, this readme won't be too complete, as I'm currently uploading the file and sorting things out... however...

###Important###

Currently, these files cannot function by themselves, as they require a *database* to function. Luckily, the way they are written, it is possible to easily transfer it to another system as *ajaxy.php* simply builds __JSON__ responses from a database. The plan is to eventually transfer this to *Websockets*
